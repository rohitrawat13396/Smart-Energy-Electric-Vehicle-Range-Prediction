3. To plot the Regression related graphs and to train regressors, run --> python  regressors.py
4. To plot the XGBoost Regressor graphs and to train the model, run --> python xgb_regressor.py
5. To run the LSTM and 4 layered NN and to make related plots, run --> python LSTM_NN.py
6. To run the Ensembled Model and to make related plots, run --> python main.py
7. We have pre computed and saved the predicted values of models in ./predictions/ directory.
8. ./dataset --> Main un processed dataset.
9. data_clean.py --> To clean the dataset from directory mentioned in 8. Note: We have already saved the processed dataset as mentioned in 1.
10. *.png files are the plots generated using above scripts.
